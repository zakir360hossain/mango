This game was made by Alexa Bartlett, Ibrahim Hassouna, Zakir Hossain, and Trisha Razdan. 
Mango: An Educational Bingo Game (2022) was created for the group's CPSC 071: Software Engineering semester project, under the guidance of Professor Michael Wehar.
The game follows the rules of Bingo, yet adds a creative twist, as players must match the broadcasted definition to a word on their Bingo board. Players will play either until 1 gets Bingo or the clues run out. We have code written to check for a Blackout (full board) as well, but decided not to implement it as part of the game.
